# Inform7-Game

This is a simple game made using Inform 7.

## Objective:
The idea of this project was to create an interactive fiction that needed to have a character, a npc, boxes and other inform7 structures.

## History:
Gabriel is a boy that was traveling with their parents, but during the travel they got in an accident and, unfortunatly, Gabriel still in coma in the hospital.
But, for some reason, Gabriel seems to react about your house things, so, this game is in the gabriel's house.

You will control Gabriel and he seems to think that he's really in his house, with his dogs and toys. But there's no one in the house except those 2.

The idea is to find every item that referees to the hospital or that doesn't make sense to stay at his house. After that you will be taken to the hospital, safe and awaken.
